<i>Gopala Ratnam Subramaniam (born 2 June 1956), known professionally as <strong>Mani Ratnam</strong>, is an Indian film director, screenwriter, and producer who predominantly works in Tamil cinema and few Hindi, Telugu and Kannada films. Ratnam has won six National Film Awards, four Filmfare Awards, six Filmfare Awards South,[1] and numerous awards at various film festivals across the world. In 2002, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, acknowledging his contributions to film.

Despite being born into a film family, Mani Ratnam did not develop any interest in films when he was young. Upon completion of his post graduation in management, he started his career as a consultant. He entered the film industry through the 1983 Kannada film, Pallavi Anu Pallavi. The failure of his subsequent films would mean that he was left with fewer offers. However, his fifth directorial outing, Mouna Ragam (1986), established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema. He was the director of the critically acclaimed, national award-winning movies Nayakan (1987) and Anjali (1990), both of which qualified as India's official entry for The Academy Awards.
<h2><center><strong>What makes mani sir films more special?</strong></center></h2>
Mani Ratnam is well known for his terrorism trilogy of Roja (1992), Bombay (1995), Dil Se.. (1998), and his romantic trilogy of Mouna Ragam (1986), Alaipayuthey (2000), O Kadhal Kanmani (2015).</i><br><br><br>
<i>When people came into cinemas to get a glimpse of their favorite heroes,there was one name which made people go to the cinema halls for his movies as a director. The name is Maniratnam. He may not be the first in this regard,but he certainly has been the first one in doing it for a long time.(1983-2017)To those who wait for Maniratnam movies, his fans since the times of Mouna ragam or Geethanjali or Alaipayuthey, his style of film making in the genre of Romance (and the realities of it),nowadays, gives a slight disappointment compared to the above said “Classics”.Nevertheless, there is a certain x factor in his movies that sets them apart from the other contemporary counterparts. The reasons discussed are just an opinion,and the rest is left to the reader to decide.<br><br>
<center>1. The Title</center>

Let’s start with the start itself. Any movie is a brainchild of a director,and the name does really matter in this regard. It is basically the first impression while it can subtly convey the theme of the movie itself. An ideal title will give a complete feeling, when you look back at it after you have watched the entire story. Now getting back to Maniratnam, his movie titles have done it all. They range from simple names to poetic phrases, they do standout from the counterparts.<br><br>

<center>2. The Character Definitions:</center>

It’s a dream for many of the leading actors to be in a Maniratnam movie.Ever thought why? Apart from the obvious tag that comes with the fame,it is the way he sculpts and project the actor as a refined form of themselves, a way in which they were never imagined before.RajiniKanth as Surya,Kamal Hassan as Sakthivel,Surya as Michael,Madhavan as Inba… the list can be quite a bit long.<br><br>

<center>3. The Leading Ladies:</center>

The leading ladies in Maniratnam movies have near-to-life images rather than showing up in the screen as mere love interests. A Maniratnam woman has her own individuality, she is recognized by her emotions and character, rather to be remembered for her looks.We remember Roja, for her innocence, helplessness, valiance and victory. Shakthi is remembered for her dilemmas and bottled up emotions while Raagini is remembered for her will and courage.<br><br>

<center>4.The Dialogues:</center>

Brevity and to the point. If dialogues in Maniratnam’s movies have taught anything at all, its definitely for us to keep our conversations to the point unless it is really necessary. It is a necessity for Anandan and Tamizhselvan to be descriptive while they speak owing to their occupations as an actor and a writer while it may not be the same for others.<br><br>

<center>5. Music and Lyrics</center>

<strong>Ilayaraja</strong> did give unforgettable classics with Maniratnam,Mouna Ragam without “mandram vandha thedraluku”, Geethanjali without “O priya”, Anjali without “something something”,Nayagan without “Neeyoru kaadhal” and Thalapathy without “Kaatukuyilu” will be incomplete.But , it is because of him , A.R.Rahman made his debut in Roja with lyrics written by none other than our very own Vairamuthu and as the folks say, the rest is history.<br><br>

<center>6. Cinematography</center>

His movies are a visual treat for the audience.The fact that he is very specific with the cameramen he chooses to work with,explains his love for the shots which are an extension of his thoughts,starting from P.C.Sreeram,Santhosh shivan to the latest Ravivarman, his choices have worked out very well.<br><br>

<center>7. The Emotions</center>

Now now, what is a movie without emotions? But it is definitely not a Maniratnam trademark if it doesn’t have any. It is this which gives his movies,that near-to-reality feel.This is what makes the characters to be felt as one among the masses and not just another celluloid extravaganza.Apart from these , its always the little details that he adds in,like the ever speeding trains,the mirror shots, the Bharathi references,the pretty “bus romances” which we see as an extension of his own tastes into his creations,while gradually becoming our own.</i><br><br><br>
